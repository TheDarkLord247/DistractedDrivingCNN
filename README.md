# DistractedDrivingCNN

 This is a CNN model which takes in a front-facing image of a driver and predicts whether the driver is drinking a beverage, using a mirror, using the radio or is focused on the road (attentive).


To run the code on your device, simply download main.cpp and make sure you have the relevant packages installed.

Do run this line in terminal once for the data:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/raghakot/keras-vis.git -U
```
